Cowsay Characters and Fortune Files

This is a collection of files for the cowsay and fortune program.

Cows should go in /usr/share/cows.

Fortunes should go in /usr/share/fortune.

If you want to create your own fortune files, there is a good description at https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1343692 for how to do it.

You will need to install cowsay and fortune to use these files. Enjoy!

These are just for fun and no copyright infringement is intended. I am not connected to Blizzard in any way. I just have a brother who loves their games and wanted to customize his computer.
